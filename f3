DESCRIPTION
       Less is a program similar to more (1), but it has many  more  features.
       Less  does  not  have to read the entire input file before starting, so
       with large input files it starts up faster than text  editors  like  vi
       (1).  Less uses termcap (or terminfo on some systems), so it can run on
 Manual page less(1) line 1 (press h for help or q to quit)
