DESCRIPTION
       Less is a program similar to more (1), but it has many  more  features.
       Less  does  not  have to read the entire input file before starting, so
       with large input files it starts up faster than text  editors  like  vi
       (1).  Less uses termcap (or terminfo on some systems), so it can run on
       a variety of terminals.  There is even  limited  support  for  hardcopy
       terminals.   (On  a hardcopy terminal, lines which should be printed at
       the top of the screen are prefixed with a caret.)

       Commands are based on both more and vi.  Commands may be preceded by  a
       decimal number, called N in the descriptions below.  The number is used
       by some commands, as indicated.

COMMANDS
       In the following descriptions, ^X means control-X.  ESC stands for  the
       ESCAPE  key;  for  example  ESC-v  means  the  two  character  sequence
       "ESCAPE", then "v".

       h or H Help: display a summary of these commands.  If  you  forget  all
              the other commands, remember this one.

       SPACE or ^V or f or ^F

       SPACE or ^V or f or ^F
              Scroll  forward  N  lines,  default  one  window  (see option -z
              below).  If N is more than  the  screen  size,  only  the  final
              screenful  is displayed.  Warning: some systems use ^V as a spe‐
              cial literalization character.

       z      Like SPACE, but if N is specified, it  becomes  the  new  window
              size.

       ESC-SPACE
              Like  SPACE,  but  scrolls  a full screenful, even if it reaches
              end-of-file in the process.

       ENTER or RETURN or ^N or e or ^E or j or ^J
              Scroll forward N lines, default 1.  The entire N lines are  dis‐
              played, even if N is more than the screen size.

       d or ^D
              Scroll forward N lines, default one half of the screen size.  If
              N is specified, it becomes the new default for subsequent d  and
              u commands.

       b or ^B or ESC-v
              Scroll  backward  N  lines,  default  one  window (see option -z
              below).  If N is more than  the  screen  size,  only  the  final
              screenful is displayed.

       w      Like  ESC-v,  but  if  N is specified, it becomes the new window

/pattern
              Search forward in the file for the N-th line containing the pat‐
              tern.  N defaults to 1.  The pattern is a regular expression, as
              recognized  by  the  regular expression library supplied by your
              system.  The search starts at the first line displayed (but  see
              the -a and -j options, which change this).

              Certain  characters  are  special if entered at the beginning of
              the pattern; they modify the type of search rather  than  become
              part of the pattern:

              ^N or !
                     Search for lines which do NOT match the pattern.

              ^E or *
                     Search  multiple  files.   That is, if the search reaches
                     the END of the current file without finding a match,  the
                     search  continues  in  the  next file in the command line
                     list.

              ^F or @
                     Begin the search at the first line of the FIRST  file  in
                     the  command  line  list, regardless of what is currently
                     displayed on the screen or the settings of the -a  or  -j
                     options.

              ^K     Highlight  any text which matches the pattern on the cur‐
                     rent screen, but don't move to the first match (KEEP cur‐
                     rent position).

              ^R     Don't  interpret  regular expression metacharacters; that
                     is, do a simple textual comparison.

       ?pattern
              Search backward in the file for the  N-th  line  containing  the
              pattern.   The  search starts at the line immediately before the
              top line displayed.
